    "body": "Fixes #3472 \r\n\r\nWe have `bookmarkingDisposeble` for handling the bookmark which is perfectly working when we are opening a new zim file and with a previously open zim file, but the problem was if a zim file is opened and we are switching between screens then the bookmark functionality was broken. Because we are disposing the `bookmarkingDisposeble` if the screen is not visible to the user, to avoid memory leak. But when the screen is again visible to the user then we were not setting up `bookmarkingDisposeble` to handle the bookmarks that's the reason the bookmark functionality was broken, now we have set up the `bookmarkingDisposeble` again when the reader is visible to the user.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/assets/34593983/3df8a8f7-5dd3-4289-bbd5-858d6fc63f75\r\n\r\n\r\n",
