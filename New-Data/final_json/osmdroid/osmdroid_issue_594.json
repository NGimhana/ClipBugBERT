    "body": "I've been using osmdroid for some time in my app. Recently some crashes and errors showed up in G Play console so I decided to upgrade the library to the latest version. \r\nThe problems are still here.\r\n1. The MapView (defined in XML) is loading very slow on many devices. Vid: https://pcmlich.fit.vutbr.cz/tmp/20170430_131608.mp4\r\n2. Zooming is lazy and when you zoom fast, the app crashes.\r\n\r\nI am using offline tiles from zip archive. JPG overlay as the base layer and PNG overlay for showing airspace layer. Then I draw a KML overlay by bonuspack (in asynctask). It consists of around 50 markers and 20 polylines.\r\n\r\n**1st ANR error from Google Play:**\r\nosmdroid-android:5.6.4\r\nGalaxy S5 mini (kminilte), Android 4.4\r\nANR Input dispatching timed out (Waiting because the touched window has not finished processing the input events that were previously delivered to it.)\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/zJLskTfM\r\n\r\n**2nd ANR error from Google Play:**\r\nosmdroid-android:5.1@aar\r\nGalaxy A5(2016) (a5xelte), Android 6.0\r\nANR Input dispatching timed out (Waiting to send non-key event because the touched window has not finished processing certain input events that were delivered to it over 500.0ms ago. Wait queue length: 38. Wait queue head age: 20516.9ms.)\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/3J8XcaS5\r\n\r\n**3rd ANR error**\r\nosmdroid-android:5.6.4\r\nGalaxy S5 (klte), Android 6.0\r\nANR Input dispatching timed out (Waiting to send non-key event because the touched window has not finished processing certain input events that were delivered to it over 500.0ms ago. Wait queue length: 6. Wait queue head age: 20066.8ms.)\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/zJMKKTk1\r\n\r\nI tried to revert to the previous version again and ended up here: http://imgur.com/a/0WNg3\r\nThis is from the S5 mini. (I am talking to one of the users who reported the bug). As you can see, the airspace is loaded but the base layer is not. He can move the map, but once he zooms in, the app crashes.\r\n\r\nI am fine on my Honor 8 and I was not able to reproduce it on some other devices I have or AVD.\r\nAny clues?\r\n\r\n",
