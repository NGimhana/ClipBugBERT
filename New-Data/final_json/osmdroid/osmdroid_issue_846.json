    "body": "## Issue Type\r\n\r\n[x] Bug\r\n\r\n## Description and/or steps/code to reproduce the problem\r\n\r\nSometimes, when pinch-zooming, the map enters an infinite redraw loop, where tiles are reloaded and removed indefinitely. Please see a video shot here: [infinite redraw bug](http://flora-on.pt/infinite-redraw.mp4)\r\nI don't have any clue of what triggers this issue. It just happens \"sometimes\", not very frequently. If you zoom to other place, sometimes it goes back normal. Sometimes comes back again. You see the video!\r\nWhen this happens, the app freezes on detach. No error messages are thrown.\r\nHas anybody experienced this? Can you replicate?\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n### If it's a bug, version(s) of android this affects:\r\n\r\nAPI 23\r\n\r\n### Version of osmdroid the issue relates to:\r\n\r\n6.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n",
