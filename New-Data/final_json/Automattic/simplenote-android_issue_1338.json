    "body": "This comes from Google Play [review](https://link.reviewbot.io/review/hWBC6R_QD):\r\n\r\n> The SEARCH function was the main advantage of this app.When we searched for a word, the result was positioned on the 1st occurrence of the word and proposed the other occurrences. No other competing note app offers this. This was decisive in my choice of app. Since the last update (Feb 2021), if there is only 1 occurrence, the cursor is placed at the end of the note.\r\n\r\nAfter some testing it definitely looks like there is an inconsistency in this place. However, the scroll position can be both correct and 'bottom of the note' for both cases of multiple or single match.\r\n\r\n### Expected\r\nIf a note contains a search match, tapping a note should show the match. Or, at least, be opened with a consistent scroll position.\r\n\r\n### Observed\r\nThe scroll position can be both correct and 'bottom of the note' for both cases of multiple or single match.\r\n\r\n### Reproduced\r\n1. Have a note that contains some unique keyword (only once, only in one note)\r\n2. Start search against this keyword\r\n3. Tap the note ~> you might firstly see the keyword shown on screen\r\n4. Go back to note list and tap the note again ~> you might see the note scrolled to bottom.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73365754/110334627-a67b9c80-802b-11eb-9ee6-c25d524e220f.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\nDevice Make: Samsung\r\nDevice Model: A31\r\nAndroid Version: 10\r\nSimplenote Version: 2.17-rc-1",
