    "body": "This is a bit of an edge-case.\r\n\r\n### Expected\r\nSince passcode is a measure to protect notes from being viewed, it should be impossible to fully view any note without passcode, if passcode is activated.\r\n\r\n### Observed\r\nWhen `Note List` widget is added, it already previews a bit of a note content, but it's up to the user (they can have condensed mode activated). The issue is that when the user clicks `New Note` button in the widget, they will not be asked for a passcode. After that, they will be able to insert an interlink to any note by typing `[...`, going to preview mode, and opening the referred note. Video below partly shows this (screenshots not available with passcode activated. The first seconds are a proof that passcode is activated, what happens next during blackout is described in steps below):\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73365754/129021663-3ef629cc-389b-4299-a8a4-ad7339bdbf4e.mp4\r\n\r\n### Reproduced\r\n1. Have passcode enabled\r\n2. Add `Note List` widget to your home screen\r\n3. Expand the widget vertically enough to see the FAB\r\n4. Tap the FAB ~> you will be redirected to new note creation without being asked for passcode. \r\n5. Enable markdown\r\n6. Type `[x` where x is a starting letter of some of your notes name\r\n7. Tap the proposed note from autocomplete pop-up ~> the interlink will be inserted\r\n8. Open Preview and tap the interlink ~> you will see the other note full content.\r\n\r\nDevice Make: Samsung Galaxy\r\nDevice Model: A31\r\nAndroid Version: 10\r\nSimplenote Version: 2.19-rc-1",
