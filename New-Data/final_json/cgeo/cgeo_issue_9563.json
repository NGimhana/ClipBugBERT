Sadly there has also been a major version update (Andriod 10 - Android 11) also last days, so I am not sure whether the upgrade caused the problem or it was introduced by recent changes on `master`.\r\n\r\n- 2020.12.20-NB\r\n- Have setting active \"Transparent background\"\r\n- Start c:geo\r\n\r\nTwo possible scenarios:\r\n- Start up takes some time and the splash screen is shown normal, afterwards normal main screen with transparent background\r\n- Start up is fast, but in that case the transparent background is replaced by an overdimensional c:geo logo for a second, afterwards normal main screen with transparent background\r\n\r\nA video might explain it better than I can with words:\r\nhttps://files.droescher.eu/public/PXL_20201221_164045435.mp4\r\n\r\n@rsudev Any relation possible to the changes for Sailfish OS?\r\n\r\n\r\n-",
