    "body": "### Describe your problem!\n\nI stumbled over an effect when using c:geo on my tablet, which makes the list spinner nearly unusable as the list spinner reacts on unwanted something like a \"mouse over\" event.\r\nI own a stylus for my tablet which supports a proximity detection to e.g. open tool tips when hovering over the screen with some millimeter distance. The problem only happens when controlling c:geo with this device.\r\n\r\nIt might sound specific, but as the distinction between hovering and touching is not easy, it makes it impossible to use the spinner.\n\n### How to reproduce?\n\n- Open stored list\r\n- Have many lists so that scrolling is needed, when tapping on the spinner to choose another list\r\n- Scrolling through this list with touched stylus (or finger) is no problem\r\n- Keep stylus hovering over some list further down but don`t touch it\r\n- Remove the stylus\n\n### Actual result after these steps?\n\nOn removing the stylus the list spinner jumps to the first list again.\r\n\r\nThe attached video might explain.\r\n- First I scroll down the selection using normal swiping\r\n- Then I hover the stylus over an entry (see the small dot on screen)\r\n- When removing the stylus (without touch) it jumps to the beginning\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/949669/151716039-3e70c079-24a4-4abf-ae65-b098239872e8.mp4\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected result after these steps?\n\nIgnore those hovering state.\n\n### Reproducible\n\nYes\n\n### c:geo Version\n\n2022.01.30-NB\n\n### System information\n\n```text\nAndroid 10, Samsung Galaxy Tab S4\n```\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_",
