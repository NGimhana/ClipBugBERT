    "body": "\r\n**Summary:** \r\nOn explore tab, When you open any media detail then on Pressing back navigation button on the toolbar it is sending back to the list fragment but it is not retaining the state of list as it is showing the list again from the starting.  \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:** \r\nOn explore tab, scroll down and open any media's details, then on media details screen press back navigation button on toolbar.\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect the app to do, and what did you see instead?\r\n\r\nWhile testing I have noticed that on pressing back button on phone it is showing the same retained state of list, but on pressing the back button on toolbar the list is basically showing from starting, So  I think it should worked the same. and Please Correct me If I am wrong.\r\n\r\n**Device and Android version:** \r\n\r\nDevice: Motorola One Fusion+, Android 10\r\n \r\n**Commons app version:** \r\n\r\n2.13.1-debug\r\nBranch: Master, Build Variant: betaDebug.\r\n\r\n**Screen-shots:** \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54663429/103571272-97278800-4ef0-11eb-9226-a42996939706.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n**Would you like to work on the issue?**\r\nYes\r\n\r\n",
