    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen in a playlist view, the app deterministically crashes when I try to grab the scrollbar from the top on the list. \r\nIf I scroll a bit with my finger beforehand, I can grab the scrollbar and move it everywhere, including to the top, without causing the app to crash. But if I drag it back to the top and try to move it from here, the app crashes too.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Go to the \"Playlists\" tab\r\n2. Open a playlist that has enough tracks to make it scrollable (9+ tracks on my device)\r\n3. Drag the scrollbar when it is at the top of the list. The app immediately crashes.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nI captured the crash in video, also showing that grabbing the scrollbar from the top works in \"Songs\" and \"Albums\" tabs:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11810912/148751602-058a1ad5-150b-4751-bb9b-84acbcc6381a.mp4\r\n\r\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Device: OnePlus 7 Pro (GMT1913)\r\n- Android Version: 11\r\n- ROM: Oxygen OS 11.0.3.1.GM21BA\r\n- Vinyl Music Player Version: 1.3.0 (Google Play Store)",
