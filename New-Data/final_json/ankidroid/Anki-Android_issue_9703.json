    "body": "## Purpose / Description\r\nWeb view's are capable of previewing SVG's so why not allow users to add svg's easily?\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\nFixes #9606 \r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nNow users can add svg's seamlessly.\r\na resource string was added, `multimedia_editor_svg_preview` translations needs to be added.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nUnit Tests and tested on phone.\r\n\r\n## Learning (optional, can help others)\r\nFirstly, I tried to make the preview of SVG possible. Knowing, if the extension of the svg file is changed to .png it easily gets converted into a PNG. I tried making a copy of file as png and renaming the first file as the second but that didn't work as that can only be done on the original image and not the one we internalize using ankidroid mechanism. Then I also tried to create a new file as svg taking the original path URI but that failed too. looked for dependencies for SVG to png support but didn't get anything solid. \r\nAs everything failed I just created a Toast and we are not previewing the SVG anymore, though it will be available on the web view.\r\n\r\n## Video\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46752548/138584504-a4b5e01a-e081-421c-810a-2cf765801ad3.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [x] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
