    "body": "###### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Use AnkiDroid 2.16alpha34\r\n2. Have tap gestures on. My settings are tap anywhere and it shows the answer. With answer shown, tap anywhere for \"good\".\r\n3. Tap to show the card answer. Attempt to click the resources button to show more information, and it does so but also registers it as a tap to answer good, and moves onto the next card.\r\n\r\n\r\n###### Expected Result\r\n\r\nShould just open the resources\r\n\r\n###### Actual Result\r\n\r\nOpens resources and also answers good simultaneously.\r\n\r\n###### Debug info\r\nAnkiDroid Version = 2.16alpha34\r\n\r\nAndroid Version = 11\r\n\r\nManufacturer = samsung\r\n\r\nModel = SM-G973U\r\n\r\nHardware = qcom\r\n\r\nWebview User Agent = Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 11; SM-G973U Build/RP1A.200720.012; wv) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/96.0.4664.45 Mobile Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nACRA UUID = 487fa2e4-17f0-4422-8e3f-dcf2a6ee4f3b\r\n\r\nScheduler = std2\r\n\r\nCrash Reports Enabled = false\r\n\r\nDatabaseV2 Enabled = true\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85033548/145508444-5958cdd8-14ed-45b2-8620-7d3f3af88193.mp4\r\n\r\n^All I'm doing here is tapping once to show the answer, then I clicked on the \"First Aid\" button once. As you can see, it opens the corresponding First Aid image, but also clicks \"Good\" on the card and moves onto the next. \r\n\r\n###### Research\r\n*Enter an [x] character to confirm the points below:*\r\n\r\n- [ x] I have read the [support page](https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html) and am reporting a bug or enhancement request specific to AnkiDroid\r\n- [ x] I have checked the [manual](https://ankidroid.org/docs/manual.html) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/FAQ) and could not find a solution to my issue\r\n- [ x] I have searched for similar existing issues here and on the user forum\r\n- [x ] (Optional) I have confirmed the issue is not resolved in the latest alpha release ([instructions](https://docs.ankidroid.org/manual.html#betaTesting))\r\n\r\n",
