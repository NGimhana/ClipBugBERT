So I reset the variable in the onPause function of the activity.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nPhysical Device: Realme 8i\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [ ] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [ ] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [ ] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [ ] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n\r\nIn the video, I have demonstrated that it requires two back presses to exit the app and then in the next turn I went to a different activity and came back to the original and still it took two back presses not one which was the issue I resolved\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73571511/161382224-d1eadb3a-ad47-40ed-b989-58b47da6c197.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n",
