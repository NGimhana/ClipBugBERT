If a person is having let's say a 100+ decks then it might get difficult to have a count of total decks. So the idea is to give numbering to the decks.\r\n\r\n2.As by default we have decks arranged in alphabetical order but we can have options where user can select if they want to sort the decks in alphabetical order or any other order like time of creating a deck etc.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40427461/167123828-f12e5730-a61b-4fec-8672-3cf04dab80b3.mp4\r\n\r\n",
