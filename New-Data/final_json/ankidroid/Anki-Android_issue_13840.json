Because the parameter passed in `CompatHelper.compat.hasVideoThumbnail()` this function is `soundPath`, but we need to pass `soundUriPath`. Therefore the method returns false instead of true\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\nFixes #13837 \r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nChanged soundPath to soundUriPath\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested on Emulator ( Pixel 5 API 33 )\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/assets/65113071/0ea4a0be-e3ee-46cb-ba42-7d81976d4da5\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [ ] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
