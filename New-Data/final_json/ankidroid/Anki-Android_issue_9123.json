    "body": "## Purpose / Description\r\nMigrating user data to a scoped storage directory (external only for now) in order to preserve access to user data under scoped storage.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\nTakes a step towards fixing #5304. Fixes #9107.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nUses storage permission (which AnkiDroid already asks for) to access legacy storage and migrates the data to the External App-Specific Directory (given by ```getExternalFilesDir()```)\r\nMigration is done by launching a ```MigrateToScoped``` task  of type ```CollectionTask.Task```\r\n\r\nAny file within the AnkiDroid folder can be accessed under Scoped Storage post-migration.\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\n1. Option to choose their default directory (internal or external)\r\n2. Support accessing certain non-app-specific locations - needed in some cases for accessing media (eg: like adding an audio clip to a note which was recorded by some other app, and isn't in the AnkiDroid folder)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- SAMSUNG Galaxy A80 (SM-A805F) API 30 (Physical Device)\r\n- SAMSUNG Galaxy S7 (SM-G930F) API 26 (Physical Device)\r\n\r\nTested Robustness manually by repeatedly closing the app mid-migration. Reopening & allowing the migration to complete resulted in the collection being opened successfully.\r\n\r\n## Important\r\n- User Data is only being copied from the Legacy Directory, not deleted for now. That can be done once all use cases work under Scoped Storage\r\n- To enable the Scoped Storage Functionality, set AnkiDroidApp's ```TESTING_SCOPED_STORAGE``` to ```true```\r\n- ```TESTING_SCOPED_STORAGE``` is set to false by default and will be set to true once the app can access external media (to be done in a later PR)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n\r\n## Demonstration Video\r\n\r\nIn this video, I first open the version of the app without Scoped Storage Functionality. I then install the PR's version (0:18 in the video) and it migrates my data from the Legacy Directory to the Scoped Storage Directory. After which, the application doesn't require permission to access the AnkiDroid folder. Media stored elsewhere will be handled in a later PR. \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29615198/122638163-0c3bf200-d10c-11eb-9a8e-f627433f7ed1.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n",
