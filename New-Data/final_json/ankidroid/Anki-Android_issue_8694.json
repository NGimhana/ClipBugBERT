I have changed that too starting a newActivity instead.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46752548/115993514-c1609b00-a5f0-11eb-8960-67ff94b19f9b.mp4\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [ ] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [x] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
