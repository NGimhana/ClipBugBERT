    "body": "## Pull Request template\r\n\r\n## Purpose / Description\r\nAdding an explicit `Add video clip` button to the Note Editor popup multimedia menu, which does the same thing as `Add audio clip` button. \r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\nFixes #10212 \r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nAnkiDroid supports adding video clips to notes, but through the `Add audio clip` button. Adding an explicit button for video clips that does the same thing as `Add audio clip` is the first step in splitting out the functionality between audio and video. \r\nThe approach used was:\r\n1. Creating a vector icon for the button. \r\n2. Creating a string for `Add video clip` in `AnkiDroid/src/main/res/values/16-multimedia-editor.xml`\r\n3. Adding the button as an item in `AnkiDroid/src/main/res/menu/popupmenu_multimedia_options.xml` with the same ID as `Add audio clip` to get the same functionality.\r\n\r\n### Final result:\r\n1. UI change in Note Editor:\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86671025/154489557-e255bd87-82c8-4d3c-b321-a4959e752b28.png\" width=\"300\" inline = \"true\" >\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86671025/154489685-0e507aae-5250-48f6-ad7f-dedb79affcd6.png\" width=\"300\" inline = \"true\" >\r\n\r\n2. Video showing functionality:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86671025/152965551-f87f90c3-4963-4351-9745-b00a30cfadb7.mp4\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThe changes were run and tested on the v2.16alpha41 build of AnkiDroid both on an emulator and an android device (details below). No unit tests were run, Testing was only done by running the app on both the emulator and the device. During this testing an issue #10315 also came up, but it does not affect the actual implementation of the feature. \r\n\r\nEmulator:\r\nPixel 5 API 32\r\n\r\nDevice:\r\nXaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro API 28 (Android 9)\r\n## Learning (optional, can help others)\r\n1. How to traverse the AnkiDroid code, find usages of methods and variables in Android Studio. \r\n2. How to create a new drawable vector icon in Android Studio. \r\n3. How to add Strings to the code. \r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
