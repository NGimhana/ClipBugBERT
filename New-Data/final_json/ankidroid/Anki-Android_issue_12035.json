    "body": "## Pull Request template\r\n\r\n## Purpose / Description\r\nAdd the functionality to see only one card per note when enabled, following upstream Anki Note mode of the Browser. Especially helpful when you have for example a lot of cloze deletions in one note, with this feature you can choose to see only one card instead of all of them.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\nFixes #7939 \r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nBy creating a variable to keep track of whether the browser is currently in Cards mode or Notes mode, different `Search` functions (committed earlier) are called accordingly. Part 1 of this commit just introduces the feature to view one card by note, further commits will include accommodating the column headers and their values (eg: avg. ease) to correctly display the values accordingly.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86671025/185841802-0512a40c-e7c2-4bc5-9865-e5f71247c1ab.mp4\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
