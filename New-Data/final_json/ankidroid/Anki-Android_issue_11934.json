    "body": "## Purpose / Description\r\n~~On top of #11919~~\r\n\r\nThis is the last preferences reorganization PR I want to do for GSoC. Previously I'd thought about moving all the preferences from Advanced to the other screens, but after thinking a while, I've come to the conclusion that the it's best to keep it as a bucket of \"Things most users won't need or are really advanced, therefore they shouldn't dispute space with the relevant ones\".\r\n\r\nAs an example we have `Simple typed answer formatting`, only useful if typed answer is used AND the typed answer uses Polytonic Greek characters AND older webviews are being used (see #7901 if you are curious).\r\n\r\nOther preferences there will be gone some day (e.g. `Replace newlines with HTML` when the visual editor is implemented). Others can be moved to the activities they impact (e.g. `Default deck when opening statistics` being moved to the statistics screen). And others need analytics (#11642) to evaluate if they can be discarded.\r\n\r\nSo, overall there isn't anything else I want to move right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n- Moved preferences:\r\n    - `HTML/Javascript debug`: Advanced \u2192 Developer options\r\n    - `Card browser` and `Anki card` context menus, and `Press back twite to go back/exit`: Advanced \u2192 General\r\n    - `Card browser font scaling`: Appearance \u2192 Accessibility\r\n- Removed `V2 scheduler` preference\r\n    - 142f789a7bddaf46fbc4f9bd7e32defd3e4ae84d forces/requires/prompts to use the V2 scheduler when the user tries to study, so this preference is no longer necessary\r\n- Build summaries for the remaining categories (General, Appearance and Advanced)\r\n- Some cleanups around HeaderFragment.kt\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nOpened the app and opened the preferences categories to see if I get any crash\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69634269/181976491-8194e168-c999-48b6-a33e-c46ec44dd99e.mp4\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [X] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [X] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [X] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [X] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [X] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [X] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
