The java locales library is well known for being problematic and has created some issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the demo of the issue of languages having their names changed (here depicted by changing from english to japanese)\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69634269/218898599-d0fbf6e9-7406-4040-a6ad-a166f867584f.mp4\r\n\r\nHere's another example. `Gothic` isn't how the gothic language is called in gothic\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69634269/218899021-406921b7-3119-4faf-92d0-6d4797b060dd.png)\r\n\r\nAnd here is a language that hasn't got its name built correctly, so it used its language code (tl is the code of Tagalog)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69634269/218899180-026d5336-f8d4-493b-a5b1-ca37e65fcd8f.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add a string to `01-core.xml` to represent each language name on their respective languages\r\n",
