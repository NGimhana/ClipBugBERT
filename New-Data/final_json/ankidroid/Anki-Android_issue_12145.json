    "body": "## Pull Request template\r\n\r\n## Purpose / Description\r\nThe current functionality for filters does not allow them to stay persistent, i.e, if I select some filters, apply them, and open the sheet again, those filters get reset. This PR improves on that and allows filters to stay persistent unless explicitly cleared.\r\n\r\nMinor refactoring has also been performed.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nBy passing in the `flagSearchItems` list to the `FlagsAdapter` class, It can check whether a filter is selected or not during the view binding, and depending on that, the selected/unselected look is set.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86671025/186949439-7d82618f-f380-4ad0-b280-fe33308c8c33.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
