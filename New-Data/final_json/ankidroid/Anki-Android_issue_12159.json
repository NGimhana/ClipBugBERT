For FAB in Decks activity the parent Linear Layout has padding of `12dp` and margin of `10dp`. \r\n\r\nSo to make the Card Browser's FAB match the exact value we add extra `22dp` to the end (10+12) and extra `12dp` to the bottom (because for parent Linear layout for Deck's FAB there is just padding of `12dp` and no margins).\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nManually tested on Physical Android device\r\n\r\n### Before\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40427461/186459272-862b016e-219b-4196-9ef8-c175886e1438.mp4\r\n\r\n### After\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40427461/186459446-598f8333-ae94-491b-a282-806012f19ee2.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [x] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
