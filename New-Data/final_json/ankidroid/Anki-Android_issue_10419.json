It should behave like Anki desktop does:\r\n- Keep the original filename\r\n- Check its checksum when another file has the same name to see if they are equal. If not, append its checksum\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69634269/156067337-3caacbe8-754f-4b35-90b1-383a533e096e.mp4\r\n\r\nAnki desktop behavior:\r\n(reuploaded the same audio 3 times and it does not make any unnecessary copies. Tried with a different audio and its checksum was added)\r\n![2022_02_28-19_08_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69634269/156067516-68bc3c8a-3fad-420f-a5d6-5c82c8128e5f.png)\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @BrayanDSO in https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/10329#issuecomment-1054717905_\r\n\r\nSimilar behavior to #9116, but audio files are handled by different methods, so I kept the PR I made only to images. I guess video clips have the same problem, as they seem to be imported the same way as audio",
