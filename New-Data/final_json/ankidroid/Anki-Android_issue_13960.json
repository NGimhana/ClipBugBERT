    "body": "## Purpose / Description\r\nI had this branch from back the time of my GSoC project, but didn't finish it. Looking at #13957 remembered me of that so I finished it before I forgot to do it again.\r\n\r\nThe main reason of this PR is to replace the `SeekBarPreferenceCompat` usages with something better. The main issue with it is that it has an unnecessary tap to show a dialog to configure it and it looks bad.\r\n\r\nThe initial alternative would be to replace it with some `androidx.preference.SeekBarPreference` but they look very simple and aren't very customizable, so I built a new preference class based on the material Slider to use instead\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nSee the description above\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nSDK 29 emulator\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/assets/69634269/871d7af3-4404-4f65-b8fe-4430aac6555a\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/assets/69634269/c3e47ee5-8ff7-49b5-aa3c-06179fdc916e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Learning (optional, can help others)\r\n_Describe the research stage_\r\n\r\n_Links to blog posts, patterns, libraries or addons used to solve this problem_\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [X] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [X] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
