    "body": "###### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Click on a deck to study the cards while the device is portrait\r\n2. Note the `Edit note` and `Replay audio` buttons are not in the top right\r\n3. Rotate the device horizontally and note that the `Edit note` and `Replay audio` buttons are still not there\r\n4. Back out to Decks screen\r\n5. Click on a deck to study the cards while the device is horizontal\r\n6. Note the `Edit note` and `Replay audio` buttons are now in the top right (even for cards without audio)\r\n7. Rotate the device to portrait and note that the `Edit note` and `Replay audio` buttons are still there (even for cards without audio)\r\n\r\n\r\n###### Expected Result\r\n1. The visibility of overflow buttons should be consistent regardless of initial device orientation when selecting a deck\r\n2. Optionally, the replay audio button should not appear on cards with no audio (perhaps this should be a separate issue)\r\n3. Optionally, the replay audio button appears to be redundant given there's already a play audio button next to the word itself. Although, this could be considered by design and falls under [removing the audio play button](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/Advanced-formatting#remove-the-audio-play-button-from-flashcards) in the FAQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n###### Actual Result\r\nButtons tagged to show `ifRoom` show up when a deck has been clicked on while the device is horizontal and remain there until backed out. This means the user could be studying a card horizontally, but depending on their device orientation when they initially clicked on a card, the buttons may or may not be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n###### Debug info\r\n```\r\nAnkiDroid Version = 2.15.6\r\n\r\nAndroid Version = 12\r\n\r\nManufacturer = samsung\r\n\r\nModel = SM-S901U\r\n\r\nHardware = qcom\r\n\r\nWebview User Agent = Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 12; SM-S901U Build/SP1A.210812.016; wv) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/99.0.4844.88 Mobile Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nACRA UUID = 6513c4b2-d751-40e6-9fab-f42c1fc1e7f9\r\n\r\nScheduler = std2\r\n\r\nCrash Reports Enabled = false\r\n\r\nDatabaseV2 Enabled = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n###### Research\r\n*Enter an [x] character to confirm the points below:*\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [support page](https://ankidroid.org/docs/help.html) and am reporting a bug or enhancement request specific to AnkiDroid\r\n- [x] I have checked the [manual](https://ankidroid.org/docs/manual.html) and the [FAQ](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/wiki/FAQ) and could not find a solution to my issue\r\n- [x] I have searched for similar existing issues here and on the user forum\r\n- [x] (Optional) I have confirmed the issue is not resolved in the latest alpha release ([instructions](https://docs.ankidroid.org/manual.html#betaTesting))\r\n\r\n###### Example video\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71997294/161393085-0b134f9b-059e-4264-8f1b-62c9572e7af3.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n",
