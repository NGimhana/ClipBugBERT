Progress bar updates every time a card is deleted. If no cards remain, Deck Picker is opened. Indexing still needs more work, need help with that. Navigating back leads to the Card Browser.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the video, the correct card is sometimes not shown when a card is deleted unless we navigate back to it from another card. I suspect it is a flaw in my logic, would be grateful for help in improving the `mIndex` logic.\r\n\r\nTill the Indexing logic is fixed, not ready to merge. (Will convert to draft till fixed if needed)\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86671025/158470842-fbb78434-84a1-463b-9c1a-9c509c0f6932.mp4\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested on emulator and my phone. Happy to add suggested Unit Tests. None added as of now.\r\n\r\nEmulator:\r\nPixel 5 API 32\r\n\r\nDevice:\r\nXaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro API 28 (Android 9)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
