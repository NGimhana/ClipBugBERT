    "body": "## Purpose / Description\r\nThis pull request unifies UI in all flashcard viewers. Previously previewers had their own UI which had its own disadvantages, such as:\r\n - there was no proper overlapping of webview with navigation buttons, so if card has custom background, webview bounds become visible which is kind of annoying to look at;\r\n - navigation buttons had too much shadow;\r\n - buttons were tall and clumsy.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nThis pull request changes the design of navigation buttons and flip card button, following [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/design/navigation/understanding-navigation.html).\r\n\r\n[<img alt=\"Screenshot\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53416430/91419736-f825bc00-e87d-11ea-880d-74bda2f2708d.jpg\" width=300>](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/701922522836369498/748416530689294417/SVID_20200827_123404_1.mp4)\r\n\r\nIf you like the current UI more, it's fine, you can reject this one. I just wanted to make them more consistent and logical, and as a side effect more intuitive.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nSDK 28 Android 9 HUAWEI Honor 9 (STF-AL10). Tests have been modified to reflect the change of flip card button ID.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n",
