    "body": "## Purpose / Description\r\nSee #13671. Also, the migration failed notification was simply displaying `toString()` of the exception which wasn't adequate and wasn't what the migration failed dialog did.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\nFixes #13667, supersedes and closes #13671\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n* Move the code into app id-based package, also tests;\r\n* Introduce the concepts of translatable strings and translatable exceptions;\r\n* Make `AggregateException` translatable;\r\n* Use big text style for the migration failed notification\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1710718/235327985-83594ee6-8393-4d03-84fb-ea1da1c1f508.mp4\r\n\r\nNote: translatable strings/exceptions might be an overkill but this allows quickly making existing exceptions translatable. Just implement one method and make sure the UI calls through to `getUserFriendlyErrorText`. I'm not saying that is is the best idea ever, but certainly is *an* idea...\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested on my device. Disclaimer: at the time I have not self-reviewed this as much as I'd like to.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [x] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
