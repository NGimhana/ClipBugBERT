If there is change in width or height then we use `createScaledBitmap()` to rescale the bitmap to new width and height. If the specified width and height are the same as the current width and height of the source bitmap, the source bitmap is returned and no new bitmap is created.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nManually Tested on Device :\r\nModel : Asus Max Pro M2\r\nAndroid Version : 9\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40427461/173514866-af20565e-493f-40c8-bc3d-d7f9e99954ba.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Learning (optional, can help others)\r\n_Describe the research stage_\r\n_Links to blog posts, patterns, libraries or addons used to solve this problem_\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap#createScaledBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap,%20int,%20int,%20boolean)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n_Please, go through these checks before submitting the PR._\r\n\r\n- [x] You have not changed whitespace unnecessarily (it makes diffs hard to read)\r\n- [x] You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line, max 50 chars).\r\n- [x] Your code follows the style of the project (e.g. never omit braces in `if` statements) \r\n- [x] You have commented your code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] You have performed a self-review of your own code\r\n- [ ] UI changes: include screenshots of all affected screens (in particular showing any new or changed strings)\r\n- [ ] UI Changes: You have tested your change using the [Google Accessibility Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor)\r\n",
