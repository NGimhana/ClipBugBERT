    "body": "###### Reproduction Steps\r\nFirst of all, I think this bug may stem from that Card Brower can't show filter deck.\r\nOpening a filter deck and starting to learn, but I wanted to search a word similar in another dech, so opened Card Browser and changed to another deck to search. But when I back to review page, and hit a button to rate current card, it suddenly skiped to an another card deck. I think my the video clip I attached has already been clear. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96645838/166408100-5c2ef3f6-d363-4cc2-90b6-55c68a27cc76.mp4\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2022-05-03-13-06-10-94_a9eef3a2a561b80d5c76daebd0f9a14c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96645838/166408114-3f428b3e-09b9-40ac-a49c-e40b98975432.jpg)\r\n![Screenshot_2022-05-03-13-06-16-56_a9eef3a2a561b80d5c76daebd0f9a14c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96645838/166408116-3c535828-4496-4302-9e9b-505abc1596f1.jpg)\r\n",
