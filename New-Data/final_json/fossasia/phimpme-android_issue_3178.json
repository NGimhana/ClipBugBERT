    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhile testing different features of the app I noticed **some issues in Sharing** clicked images. **None of the provided methods to share images is working**.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAs usual, should open a dialog box to suggest to the user different ways to share the selected image. And upon clicking any of them the image should be shared. \r\n\r\n**Recording**\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57754075/119718615-676c2300-be85-11eb-955e-4a68fda37df0.mp4\r\n\r\nAs you can see I am constantly pressing different text views and icons but no response.\r\n\r\n**Smartphone Info:**\r\n<!-- Please complete the following information -->\r\n|               | |\r\n|---------------|-|\r\n|Device         |Oppo F11|\r\n|Android Version|11    |\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI tested this twice and found the same issue. Now since I haven't gone through the code base so I guess either there is some bug or the feature is not implemented yet. In both scenarios, I would like to work on this, provided some guidance. \r\n\r\n**Would you like to work on the issue?**\r\n<!-- Please let us know if you can work on it or the issue should be assigned to someone else. -->\r\nYes\r\n",
