    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen ever using the home key to return to KISS whilst [Microsoft SwiftKey](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/swiftkey) is enabled, the first character I type appears twice in the search bar. Afterwards the keyboard and KISS operate as expected. Using the built in (awful) input keyboard 'Kika-Keyboard' I do not see this problem.\r\n\r\nLet me know anything else you need from me to help track this down.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThis does seem to take a couple of attempts attempts to start being a problem.\r\n\r\n1. return to KISS (via 'home' button)\r\n1. press the 'overview'/'recent' button (or open some other app)\r\n1. press the 'home' button (*not* the 'back' button) to return to KISS\r\n1. press a few keys on the keyboard\r\n1. observe that the first key press appears twice\r\n\r\nIf you repeat the above with another keyboard (other than Microsoft SwiftKey) there is no doubling of the first character.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA single key press results in a single character in the search box.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n....have a video of it: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2567406/188657353-5e0d17ad-16b7-472c-8b69-cb44930001d3.mp4\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n - App version: 3.16.8\r\n - App installed via: Play Store\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n * I am using a [Unihertz Titan Pocket](https://www.unihertz.com/collections/smartphones/products/titan-pocket) which comes with a *physical* keyboard ('virtual keyboard' is turned *off*).\r\n * No other apps on my phone exhibit this problem with SwiftKey, including another launcher (such as [T-UI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ohi.andre.consolelauncher))\r\n * This occurs even when I have all background apps closed.\r\n * Does not seem to affect this bug, but I have all animation transitions disabled (via Developer options)",
