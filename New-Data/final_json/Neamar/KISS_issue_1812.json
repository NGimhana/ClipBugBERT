    "body": "Heya! I've been loving the launcher so far, but for me one thing was missing. In Minimal UI mode, if your widgets cover the majority of the screen, it's difficult to ever have access to your history.\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively simple change that pulls up the history when your software keyboard is visible (note: android doesn't include a clean way to do this, so we do so by checking the view height versus root layout height, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2150078/how-to-check-visibility-of-software-keyboard-in-android).\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1109288/137422706-44859067-393a-4e35-a349-edfd2c004045.mp4\r\n\r\nThere's one known issue I'd like to resolve before pushing, if anyone has an idea where to look: When the history (shown by keyboard) has been scrolled down, selecting an item simply causes KISS to return to the widget view, without launching the selected item. Doesn't affect history opened via 'open on touch' events. ",
