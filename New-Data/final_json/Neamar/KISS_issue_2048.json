Nova launcher had this feature and i used it alot.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36887242/217930085-de083c5a-7888-4204-a27e-5e0efac7861a.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- in settings choose how many \"pages\" of favorites you want (min: 1;max: 3 for example)\r\n- On home screen you can now swipe favorites bar to the left/right to get to your different \"favorites pages\"\r\n- Search for app -> long press app -> \"Add App to Favorites\" \r\n- The app will be added to current active \"Favorite page\"\r\n\r\nI can see you have a lot of requests. I am a software developer myself but without android expierence. If you/someone could guide me where to look at, i would be happy to look at it myself and learn something new. \r\n\r\nCheers and thank you for this awesome launcher!",
