Open a notification for a new e-mail\r\n2. Wait until the message is displayed (take > 5 seconds)\r\n\r\n### When opening the app:\r\n1. Close all apps\r\n2. Open k-9 mail\r\n3. Wait until messages are displayed (see screenscast)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What I tried so far:\r\nFor the issue about notification:\r\n* Use an empty e-mail (except of the title) as in the screencast\r\n* Send an e-mail from a folder or receive from a folder (same result)\r\n\r\nIn general:\r\n* Delete all app data and reinstall completely (by using the import of e-mail configuration)\r\n* Disabled energy saving mode\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nI have 4 accounts in my k9-mail (1: ~2000 e-mails, 2: ~2531 e-mails, 3: ~10 e-mails, 4: ~10 e-mails).\r\n\r\nThe issue is not new, it's like that since months (I cannot recall, but perhaps since the redesign), but I'm seriously getting annoyed by that. I thought that it will be fixed at some point.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nShow almost immediately the messages.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12294151/216140107-7e30ec35-c3f4-41e2-a310-a7c6735d6738.mp4\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12294151/216134932-2293af61-b453-4986-8770-c95e726d1609.mp4\n\n### Logs\n\n[k9mail-logs.txt](https://github.com/thundernest/k-9/files/10560800/k9mail-logs.txt)\r\n",
