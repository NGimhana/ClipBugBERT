Receive an email with code block with longer length\r\n2. Try to scroll horizontall\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCan scroll horizontally through code block\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nK-9 tries to move to the next email instead.\r\n\r\nIn this video I tried to move very softly. There is no difference between different levels of swiping force.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1885159/189711982-42ba0437-5a46-4b64-b395-5fc6118a0197.mp4\r\n\r\n_(I know an email address is visible in the video, that's okay, it's just an alias and I'll replace it if it gets spam)_\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nNo logs, but I've included an anonymized version of the email I could trigger this on. I dragged this email into Inbox in Thunderbird to be able to confirm the anonymized version still triggers the bug in K-9 Mail but I'm sure you have your own tricks already :)\r\n\r\n[Re- org.fdroid.fdroid.debug Crash Report (#6).zip](https://github.com/thundernest/k-9/files/9550164/Re-.org.fdroid.fdroid.debug.Crash.Report.6.zip)",
