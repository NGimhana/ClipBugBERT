The K9 with the RED ICON exhibits the issue. The K9 with the PURPLE ICON, exhibits the fix.\r\n\r\nThis probably needs to get posted to the com.splitwise:tokenautocomplete:2.0.7 GITHUB also, but I started out trying to fix you, so here's an override of one of their methods.\r\n\r\nYou can recreate the issue, by typing THREE CHARS of a contact in your list with a valid email entry, then selecting the Icon/Token by tapping. The next char typed will re-generate the three previous chars in the internal buffer.\r\n\r\nThree chars is important as during the token substitution, it leaves the View selection length as is, tricking the IMM into avoiding an internal reset.\r\n",
