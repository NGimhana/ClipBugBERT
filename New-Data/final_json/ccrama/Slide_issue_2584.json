I don't like that they play automatically but it would be nice to tap it and it plays.\r\nHere is what I'm referring to: https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FatalNegligibleAmurstarfish-mobile.mp4\r\nIt would be awesome if it could be implemented on Slide.\r\nThanks for your hard work. This is my favorite app and it's been si for a while now.",
