    "body": "So I use material files and unable to access `Android/data` and `Android/obb`. But today another redditor told me he was able to get it to work with Mixplorer. I kinda figured out how it did this. Here is the recording: \n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64138578/211184012-80819449-ad81-4890-a3e1-87eca17c2833.mp4\n\nYou can see that I can have access to individual dirs in `Android/data` and `Android/obb`, but not `Android/data` and `Android/obb`,\n\nThe problem is that Android blocks RW access to `Android/data` and `Android/obb`, but not RW access to `Android/data/*` and `Android/obb/*`. So material files can access `Android/data/app.revanced.manager.flutter`, for example, but not `Android/data`.\n\nSo we just need to ask SAF to give access to `Android/data/<package_name>` and `Android/obb/<package_name>`. But how can we get the package names? You can see that Mixplorer asks for the permission for listing the installed apps, thats how it gets the name of installed packages. You can also see I allowed it to query installed packages twice, possibily for `Android/data` and `Android/obb` respectively.\n\nI hope Material files can also implement this. \n\n[Mixplorer](https://mixplorer.com/#intro)\n[Download Mixplorer](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-2-2-mixplorer-v6-x-released-fully-featured-file-manager.1523691/#post-23109280)\n\nIn the meantime, you could use material files to add another storage to `Android/data` and `Android/obb` by asking Mixplorer to grant the permission via SAF.\n\n",
