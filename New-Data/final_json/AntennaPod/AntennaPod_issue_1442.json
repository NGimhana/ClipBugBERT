    "body": "Hi,\nthis is on a Moto G running Cyanogenmod 12.1 (Android 5.1.1) and Antennapod 1.4.0.12 from F-Droid.\n\nIt seems it has become very difficult to reorder episodes in the queue, especially when moving the episode causes the view to scroll.\n\nOne example which almost always seems to mess up the queue:\n- Grab the first episode by the points on the left\n- Move it down until the view begins to scroll\n  Here already the first issue comes up: It is very difficult to control by what amount the view scrolls - just a little more makes the list scroll very fast almost immediately.\n- When now trying to scroll less fast I almost always get one or more of the following symptoms:\n  -- Other episodes being moved as well\n  -- Two episodes (other than the moved one) perpetually interchanging positions\n  This makes it very difficult to move only one episode more than a few positions without messing up the queue.\n\nI have noticed that there seems to be a related bug #1409 with similar issues which however was closed for the version (1.4.0.12) I am experiencing the issues here.\n\nI have made a small video so you can see what I mean. (Finger position indicated by the dot)\n\nhttp://www.file-upload.net/download-11090432/antennapod.mp4.html\n\nIn the video, the queue first contains episode 69..80 of the \"Mythen\" Podcast (yellow icon), ordered, with other episodes behind. I try to pull the uppermost episode downwards three times and you can see how the whole queue gets messed up.\n\nThanks for the good work for the app which I use everyday & hope that helps,\nStefan\n",
