I have `Use Episode Cover` set of `off` in settings\r\n2. I subscribed (via mobile data connection) to podcast for which AntennaPod seems to auto-generates cover with name of the podcast (e.g. https://girlinspace.libsyn.com/rss - I have no idea why it doesn't pick up the podcast image which seems to be there when I open in other RSS readers?)\r\n3. when I opened `Queue` list, I can see all podcast cover, but this specific one is just white text \"Girl in space\" on light gray background\r\n4. I scroll down several episodes\r\n5. I scroll back up, and the cover image for that podcast is gone (i.e. replaced by almost black image , actually very very dark grey, image)\r\n\r\nOther podcast (for which AntennaPod seems to have correct real image) are not affected and their cover images remain static when scrolling.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI would expect when scrolling the `Queue` down and back up the cover images wouldn't disappear, but instead remain the same as they were before.\n\n### Current behaviour\n\ncover image for every instance of that specific podcast that has scrolled off the screen disappears when I scroll back in. See attached video:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156656/171711149-610b9158-661b-4f38-bedb-cc3b1f8ca521.mp4\r\n\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_",
