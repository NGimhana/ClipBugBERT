Some hours ago, I added my Bitcoin Lightning [Node](https://1ml.com/node/03e691f81f08c56fa876cc4ef5c9e8b727bd682cf35605be25d48607a802526053)'s key to my [podcast feed](https://beginnenmetbitcoin.com/podcast.rss), as per the new [namespace spec](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace). There is more info in this [pdf](http://adam.curry.com/enc/1604698512.132_podcasting2.0.pdf).\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ciXycn9.png)\r\n\r\nSomeone just now started playing my podcast. And I get streaming payments from that listener. To be fair, the listener is a developer trying it out, but this proves that this system works. \r\n\r\nIt would be absolutely great to have this. AntennaPod would also take a percentage. This is a revolutionary step into the new era of podcasting.\r\n\r\n- [Podcast explaining the thoughts behind this <podcast:value> tag.](http://adam.curry.com/html/PC201020201106Podcas-ZV7ms5XRW9t58ntbVrTRT4WJdFKD2p.html)\r\n\r\n**Problem you may be having, or feature you want**:\r\nDirect value-to-value works best. I do not like ads. I want to pay podcasters directly, and this will do just that.\r\n\r\n**Suggested solution**:\r\nThere is quite some work to be done here. I would like to offer help where I can. It's BIG.\r\n\r\n- AntennaPod would need to become a Lightning Wallet [!]\r\n- AntennaPod would need to set up a Lightning Node to receive it's cut\r\n- AntennaPod would need to parse the <podcast:value> tag, calculate it's own percentage/cut, and send accordingly\r\n\r\n**Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details**:\r\n- [Demo from user perspective on another app](https://noagendaassets.com/enc/1604765615.522_podcasting2.0lightning.mp4)\r\n",
