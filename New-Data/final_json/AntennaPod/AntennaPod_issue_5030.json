Then I used to paste the text in a Notes app. Its cumbersome, since it takes a lot of taps. Moreover, I dont want to save each time as a separate note, but only keep one note per episode.\r\n\r\n**Suggested solution**:\r\nA quick menu option inside the Audio player screen which will show up a Notes dialog. Any existing notes from that episode will also be listed in the same \"Edit text\" box. The current playback position will be auto added. I can quickly scribble my thoughts and save. So the note for that episode will get overwritten and saved into db. (The feed title, episode title and episode url are automatically added to the start of the note)\r\n![Screenshot_20210312-220500](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3183663/110969802-1d43cd00-837f-11eb-9365-75c245bdf171.png)\r\n\r\nAlso a \"Notes\" screen in the side bar which will show me all the notes from all the episodes. Then, I can export them or copy one episode's note and put them in my main Notes app.\r\n![Screenshot_20210312-220436](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3183663/110969827-22a11780-837f-11eb-8880-c7e59eb5ecdf.png)\r\n\r\nI have implemented and tested this feature. In fact have been personally using it for more than a week.\r\n Please let me know if I can submit a pull request, if the idea and UI/UX seems ok to the team. Demo video attached.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots / Drawings / Technical details**:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3183663/110969363-9d1d6780-837e-11eb-978a-657c45875e9c.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
