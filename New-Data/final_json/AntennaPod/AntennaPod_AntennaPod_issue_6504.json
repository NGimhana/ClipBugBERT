Play an episode\r\n2. Go to the Player screen\r\n3. Slowly swipe from the middle of the screen to the bottom (to minimize the player)\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe player should be slowly swipable and should be minimized if dragged enough to the bottom\n\n### Current behaviour\n\nEach second (synchronized with the playtime of the playing podcast, so maybe due to UI updates) the dragging of the player screen gets reset and the player is full-size again. Difficult to explain, so here is a screen recording:\r\nhttps://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/assets/11487762/1855b68e-2325-429b-b25c-133fe562d7ce\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if dragged from the top of the screen (where the invisible minimized player becomes visible on drag), it won't be reset.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_",
