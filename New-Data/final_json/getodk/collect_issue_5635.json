    "body": "#### ODK Collect version\r\nv2023.2, master: 3f5ab8e84d64a27bb60ecf6cf3672b8548a07d8b\r\n#### Android version\r\n12, 13\r\n#### Device used\r\nPixel 3a, 6a\r\n#### Problem description\r\nI've encountered a few weird issues on Location Permission dialog when No background processing is set. \r\n#### Steps to reproduce the problem\r\n\r\n1. Set \"Background process limit\" to \"No background processes\" in Developer Options\r\n2. Have a fresh installation of ODK\r\n3. Open a form with a Select One From Map question\r\n4. Go to question and click \"Select Place\"\r\n5. With Location Permission dialog visible switch to another app and then back again (1. Device freeze for a few seconds before switching the app, 2. Under the Location Permission dialog the screen of the app is black)\r\n6. Click Don't Allow\r\n7. Finalize the Form (3. The screen will be blank) \r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n1. The app should not be showing the blank screen after finalizing the form\r\n2. The Device should not freeze (when switching between other apps this is not happening)\r\n3. The screen under the Location Permission dialog should not be black\r\n#### Other information \r\nThere is one more issue I encountered but I'm not able to reproduce it in 100%. Sometimes after Clicking on \"Don't Allow\" button i was moved to the first page in the form and when trying to click any button (Next, Back, Hierarchy view) the app was still stuck on the first page (you can observe this at the video around 30 sec.)\r\n\r\n**Video Attached** \r\nhttps://github.com/getodk/collect/assets/85225519/d1e8db49-3dd8-4cab-8ab0-cb02d37f3cf4",
