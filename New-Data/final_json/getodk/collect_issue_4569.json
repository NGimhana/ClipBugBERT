Create a form with a repeat that could have no contents for some instances. E.g. [vegetables.xlsx](https://github.com/getodk/collect/files/6504465/vegetables.xlsx)\r\n2. Fill out the form such that some instances are relevant and some are not. For example, select two vegetables in the attached form.\r\n3. Swipe forward to see the expected behavior.\r\n4. Swipe back to see a screen for each repeat instance, even those with no contents.\r\n5. Go to the hierarchy view from one of the \"ghost\" repeats to see more badness.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/967540/118725106-54ea4d80-b7e4-11eb-87c9-42315a3e4228.mp4\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nIf there are no visible notes in a repeat instance, that whole repeat instance should be skipped in all cases. The forward navigation behavior should be replicated.\r\n\r\n#### Other information \r\nRelated to https://github.com/getodk/collect/issues/4457.",
