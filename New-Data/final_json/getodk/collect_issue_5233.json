In device settings choose light mode.\r\n2. Go to Collect app.\r\n3. Go to Settings \u2192 User interface \u2192 Theme\r\n4. Choose \u201eDark theme\u201d.\r\n5. Go to All widgets form.\r\n6. Go to Draw widget.\r\n7. Click \u201eSketch Image\u201d.\r\n8. Click back button.\r\n9. Click \u201eIgnore Changes\u201d in \u201eExit Sketch Image\u201d dialogue.\r\n10. Click next or swipe to the next question (if necessary repeat steps 7-10 a few times).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nAfter clicking back button, the user should see the dialogue which is consistent with the chosen theme in the application. After going to the next question, the user should see information about the question consistent with the chosen theme in the application.\r\n\r\n**Other information**\r\n\r\nDraw and Signature widget -after saving changes in \u201eExit Sketch Image\u201d dialogue, the problem of changes in following questions doesn\u2019t occur (only wrong colours of dialogues).\r\nAnnotate widget- the problem doesn\u2019t occur if an image is in a vertical position.\r\nI\u2019ve also checked Android 11 with Collect v2021.2.0 and it work as expected.",
