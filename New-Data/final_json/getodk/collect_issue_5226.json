Select Google maps as a source of maps.\r\n2. Go to All widgets form.\r\n3. Go to Geotrace widget.\r\n4. Click \u201eStart Geotrace\u201d.\r\n5. Click add points button and choose \u201eplacement by tapping\u201d.\r\n6. Click start.\r\n7. Add at least 3 points creating V-shape.\r\n8. Add points between the last and the first point (close to an existing point).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nUser is able to add points between 2 points that are close to each other. Number of points entered changes and there are markers created.\r\n\r\n**Other information**\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also check on Android 8.1 and 11 Collect v2022.2.3 , Collect v2022.2.0 and Collect v2022.3 Beta 2 and it doesn\u2019t work as expected. I haven\u2019t checked earlier versions than Collect v2021.2.0.\r\n",
