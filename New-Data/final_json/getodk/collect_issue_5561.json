Go to device settings and change language to RTL language (if in settings you need add a language to reproduce the issue probably you\u2019ll need to remove English).\r\n2. Go to the main screen of the device to check the language.\r\n3. Go to Collect (if necessary in settings\u2192 User interface\u2192 Language choose English).\r\n4. Go to Fill Blank Form and check the alignment.\r\n5. Open All widgets form and go to the hierarchy view and check the alignment.\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\nIf in Collect settings there is a LTR language chosen it should be applied in all parts of the app.\r\n",
