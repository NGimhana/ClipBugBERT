The first photo for each plot could not be found, viewing any of the remaining photos would display the previous photo.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nInstall v5.4 on an S22, create a photo trait, and try taking photos.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo crashing, each photo thumbnail to open the correct corresponding photo.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11297346/228375888-b061ef7a-4496-4f14-b85c-190b3b227ff0.mp4\r\n\r\nAlso here is logcat output captured in Android studio, covering the same activity shown in the screen recording.\r\n[FieldbookErrorLog.txt](https://github.com/PhenoApps/Field-Book/files/11094519/FieldbookErrorLog.txt)\r\n\r\n**Device Info (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Model: S22\r\n - OS: not sure\r\n - Field Book Version 5.4\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n @ramierop can provide additional context.\r\n",
