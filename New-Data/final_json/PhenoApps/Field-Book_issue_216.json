    "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request includes a new BrAPI import fragment which is used when users choose \"V2\" in their preferences. The user can import multiple studies and query across multiple programs/trials. I made small changes to BrapiLoadDialog and BrapiActivity to make this work. I also noticed a potential bug in BrapiPaginationManager where the totalPages was being set to 0 instead of 1 (from my review of the code pages should always begin from 1).\r\n\r\nAlso included in this PR is a generic view for controlling pages which is used in the new BrapiImportActivity. \r\n\r\nNote about the functionality of the import page:\r\nThe user can click the bottom bar to navigate to the next filterable table. If no items were selected this works like a select all for the current page.\r\n\r\nFixes # 172\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI've tested this on a Pixel 4a API 30 emulator and moto x4. Because BrapiLoadDialog and BrapiActivity were both changed, I ensured V1 imports still work. \r\n\r\n# Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] I have made corresponding changes to documentation\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5421632/108442261-5bd0e680-721c-11eb-9a18-af46644e967e.mp4\r\n\r\n",
