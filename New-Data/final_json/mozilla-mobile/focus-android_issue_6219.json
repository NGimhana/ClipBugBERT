Tap on the shield icon > From the ETP panel, disable all the toggles from the \"Trackers and Scripts to block\".\r\n3. Perform all the steps from the last comment from issue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5245 : \r\nDisabled the ETP.\r\nAdd the page to the device's homescreen.\r\nCleared the history.\r\nOpened the shortcut from the device's homescreen - the ETP is ON/enabled, even if the page is still listed in the Exceptions.\r\n4. While the webpage opened from the home screen shortcut in step 3 is loading, quickly access the Settings > General Menu.\r\n5. Repeatedly change the theme and the language.\r\n6. Repeat steps 4-5 until the issue can be observed.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe application should behave properly. Quickly accessing the Settings menu and tapping on various options should not interfere with/affect the web page.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nIssue https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/issues/5245 was reproduced, and while the page was loading, the user was able to interfere with it while quickly changing the theme/language from Settings > General Menu.\r\nOnce a theme/language was selected, the focus was moved on the web page from step 3.\r\nAfter clearing the browsing history and selecting another theme/language option, the same page was re-opened again, each time.\r\n\r\nThis was a single time event, could not be reproduced using the same device or other devices.\r\n### Device information\r\n\r\n* Android device: Google Pixel 6 (Android 12).\r\n* Focus version: Beta 97.0.0-beta.1.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89388888/149350309-ec58f674-df63-4a88-806b-698daca7b236.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n",
