Sorry for any inconvenience.\r\nI couldn't successfully squash the commits  related to #7437. So I created a new branch(issue7430fix)  with the changes to push  to [indurs:issuefix7430](https://github.com/indurs/focus-android/tree/issuefix7430). But I forgot to commit the changes in the new branch before I pushed using \"git push origin issue7430fix:issuefix7430 -f\". I'm not sure why but the PR is closed automatically. \r\n\r\nCo-Authored-By: Mugurell <Mugurell@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12825812/183011329-664210a6-cacd-4f0e-8770-8aa28a677b2b.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pull Request checklist\r\n<!-- Before submitting the PR, please address each item -->\r\n- [ ] **Tests**: This PR includes thorough tests or an explanation of why it does not\r\n- [ ] **Screenshots**: This PR includes screenshots or GIFs of the changes made or an explanation of why it does not\r\n- [ ] **Accessibility**: The code in this PR follows [accessibility best practices](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/shared-docs/blob/master/android/accessibility_guide.md) or does not include any user facing features.
