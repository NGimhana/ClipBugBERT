Not a [question or feature request](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/issues/new/choose).\n- [X] The topic is **not** already reported at [Issues](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/issues?q=#js-issues-search). _(I've searched it)_.\n- [X] Markor **is** up to date. See [Releases](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/tags) for the latest version. Updates are available from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.gsantner.markor/) and GitHub.\n- [X] The bug is still present in the latest development version (git master). (Please [download](https://nightly.link/gsantner/markor/workflows/build-android-project/master) and try the test version of Markor, named **Mordor**. Don't worry; Markor and Mordor appear as completely separate applications. You can install both side-by-side, and Markor settings are not touched. In case the issue is resolved there, you don't need to create a bug report. The change will be part of the next Markor update.)\n\n### Description\n\nIn markdown files there are certain conditions where text is moved up seemingly overwriting previous lines in the editor view when text is entered and bigger headings are enabled.\r\n\r\nFor easier understanding I created two screen recordings showing the different behavior with bigger headings enabled & disabled:\r\n\r\n**bigger headings enabled**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97251923/211094706-ca80f2c3-b05b-471f-b740-cff04fb69efa.mp4\r\n\r\n**bigger headings disabled**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97251923/211094799-1d674528-fb2f-43c8-9c81-382c29ad8cfc.mp4\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nExisting lines should not be overwritten when entering text.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Enable bigger headings in the settings.\r\n2. Create a new empty markdown file.\r\n3. Paste the following text into the file:\r\n```\r\nTest123\r\nabc\r\n\r\n----\r\nTest\r\n----\r\n```\r\n4. Move the cursor behind \"Test\", press enter (newline) and enter some characters.\r\n5. The text is moved up seemingly overwriting the content of the lines above.\r\n6. Go back into the file overview and then reopen the markdown file.\r\n7. The previously overwritten lines are visible again.\r\n\n\n### Information\n\nAndroid version: 13\r\nDevice: Google Pixel 6a\r\nMarkor App Version: 2.10.6\r\nMordor App Version: 2.10.16-1700 (version code 221229) \n\n### Source\n\nF-Droid\n\n### Format / File type\n\nMarkdown\n\n### Additional info / Log\n\n```shell\n-\n```\n",
