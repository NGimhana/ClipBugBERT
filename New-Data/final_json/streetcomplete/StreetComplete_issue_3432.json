It is black when `GPS follow is disabled`\r\n- one can enable `GPS follow` mode (and thus turn icon orange) by clicking on GPS icon when it is black\r\n- one can disable `GPS follow` mode (and thus turn icon black) by panning the map manually\r\n\r\nIt seems to work like that when one is in range of GPS satellites. However, when GPS signal is not acquired, it is not possible to disable `GPS follow` mode - ie. the GPS icon remain orange, and one cannot turn it black by panning the map manually. \r\n\r\nI would expect I can disable `GPS follow` by same action (panning the map manually) even is GPS signal is not yet acquired.\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce**\r\n- Start SC inside building when there is no GPS signal\r\n- pan and rotate map around manually\r\n- notice the GPS icon remains orange all the time\r\n\r\n(excuse the video quality - the GPS icon remains orange color all the time in the video below)\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156656/138536611-642b88ff-3f8f-4241-944a-77e0e943d18b.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Versions affected**\r\nAndroid 6 / SC v37.0-beta1 github upstream\r\n\r\n\r\n",
