Currently (53.1, but also in 52.0) only building type (_\"Gra\u0111evina za stanovanje\"_) is shown.\r\n\r\nE.g. this way: https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/90642442\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/assets/156656/49e0c092-8053-4e6f-9000-6024cc2a129d\r\n\r\n(Only if quest is minimized and map moved can one see the address, which is very hard to use, as can be seen at ~ 00:06 in the video)\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\nShow not only building type, but also build address if present. (if space is tight, show only building address).\r\ne.g. for this example show _\"Gra\u0111evina za stanovanje, Selska cesta 72\"_)\r\n\r\nI seem to recall that address information was shown once upon a time? (So it might be a regression, or my memory is wrong? Or maybe it was different quest that have shown more of relevant information about the building?)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nThere may be several different solutions for your idea or use case, add your deliberations about it here to help sort out the best one(s).\r\nAdd screenshots or mockups to visualize your idea, if applicable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n",
