    "body": "**Use case**\r\nWhen GPS signal is lost,  it can be hard for user to know, and thus wrong mapping can occur. It happened to me several times (that I noted!), especially when map layout in new location without GPS signal was similar to map layout where GPS was last available. (such GPS signal loss happens often especially if I turn off screen to save battery as there is nothing to map for some distance, or enter/exit buildings etc.) \r\n\r\n<Details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Main visibility problems:</summary>\r\n\r\n- if the map is in \"3D follow mode\" (i.e. GPS icon shows `arrowhead` instead of `dot`), it is not possible to say **at all** if the GPS signal is available or not (in \"2D mode\", i.e. when GPS icon is shown as a `dot`, the `dot` is blinking where there is no GPS signal, so it is at least somewhat visible, although it can be surprisingly easy to overlook)\r\n- the GPS position on the map remain same shape and color, no matter if GPS is available or not\r\n- direction the phone is pointed at (i.e. the blue section of the circle in front of GPS position dot on the map) is showing direction even if the location is totally wrong, which is highly misleading. \r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nSee the video, especially about 00:00:09 - 00:00:14 for example of how misleading it can be.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156656/161667162-e8c3edbf-226b-4c55-b193-335047a17c76.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\n\r\nI propose to implement (ideally all of) following suggestions, in order to make it clear that the GPS position on the map is invalid and thus avoid user unknowingly mapping invalid data:\r\n\r\n- if the GPS signal is lost, make the `arrowhead` GPS icon **blink also** (same as when `dot` GPS icon is blinking)\r\n- if the GPS signal is lost, turn **blue** `dot` on the map indicating user position to **grey** `dot` (or `hexagon` or `smaller circle` or `hollow circle` or some other shape understandable to colorblind persons too).\r\n- if the GPS signal is lost, **disable showing** direction the phone (i.e. the blue **section of the circle** in front of GPS position dot) \r\n\r\n(all of the above should return to normal when GPS signal is reacquired, of course)",
