But some are unclickable - their name doesn't copy when I click on them.\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce**\r\n- go to e.g. this location (Bosiljevska ulica - https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/907569608)\r\n- try to solve addresses. \r\n- (Housenumber quest will work)\r\n- but in AddressStreet quest `Bosiljevska ulica` street will **not** be clickable\r\n- also `Dubrova\u010dka ulica` street will **not** be clickable\r\n- however `Ozaljska ulica` street will be clickable normally\r\n\r\nVideo: \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156656/235010761-345bc365-f717-4699-8c10-6c82a5f361b1.mp4\r\n\r\nRefreshing the map does not seem to help. It is always reproducible on that two streets, and seems to works on all other streets. Related issue https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/3816 is supposed to be fixed.\r\nThe two problematic roads are `highway=residential` and the one that is working is `highway=secondary`, but I've never before had issues with `residential` roads being ignored in that quest.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n- when clicking on any of the streets, its name would get copied, so `AddressStreet` quest can be solved\r\n\r\n**Versions affected**\r\nEMUI 12, SC v52.0\r\n",
