It is confusing and seems redundant.\r\n\r\nExample this location: https://www.openstreetmap.org/note/2894360\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156656/137835934-394a2370-a0d8-456b-b02e-3a05649a4ccb.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\n\r\n- ideally, user would be asked just one question - if there is `tactile_paving` on both sides, and if there is, two additional individual questions if it exists on each side individually would be skipped (that is, they would automatically solved by that one quest).\r\n- alternatively, if the user is asked for each of the sides if it has tactile paving, asking them again \"if it exists on both sides\" is redundant and confusing, so it should be removed. \r\n\r\n(this was logged on `SC 36.0-beta2` based my fork, but no changes related to that issues should be in there)",
