    "body": "This is again reproduced https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/4124 (and before that, https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/4086). See them for more details and history of the problem.\r\n\r\nI've managed to do both things requested in https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/4124#issuecomment-1173187068:\r\n- try with 45.x version\r\n- verify history that edits were made \r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce**\r\n- answered the cycleway quest with `no` at `2022-07-29` about `14:04 CEST` (or minute before).\r\n- noticed at `14:04 CEST` that I'm asked if the situation is still the same\r\n- started screen recording\r\n- verified in the `undo` menu that there is recorded answer `Added cycleway:right=no`\r\n- answered `no` to the `is this still the cycleway situation here?`\r\n- answered `displayed separately on the map` to the `is this still the cycleway situation here?`\r\n  (note that this answer does not match reality, but I choose different answer than `no` to be sure to get multiple changes in changeset, so I can prove the bug is not only in my mind :smile:)\r\n- verified in the `undo` menu that the new answer generated `Updated to cycleway:right=separate`\r\n- verified in the `undo` menu that there is also still recorded old answer `Added cycleway:right=no`\r\n- stopped screen recording\r\n- started uploading all quests immediately after the video ends (i.e. `14:05/14:06 CEST`)\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156656/182037500-aeb8c647-8e17-46d9-8b61-c936509c68f6.mp4\r\n\r\nI expect it is this changeset: https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/124228420#map=18/46.41630/16.69096\r\nand this way specifically:\r\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/way/670948488/history (`v8` and `v9`)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n - `is this still the cycleway situation here?` quest should not have triggered, as the cycleway quest was answered seconds (and not months/years) ago.\r\n\r\n**Versions affected**\r\n<!-- Add the Android and StreetComplete version here. Please use exact version number instead of saying \"latest\" -->\r\n45.0-based ([my fork](https://github.com/mnalis/StreetComplete/actions/runs/2679787218)), Android 10 (on Huawei P30 Pro).\r\nBut note [previous repetition of bug](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/4124) that looked exactly the same was in vanilla **_mainstream SC_** (not in my fork), so I hope the bug is the same, and so that this bugreport still helps.",
