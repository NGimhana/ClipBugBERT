The cursor in the UI snaps to nearby roads and also snaps to nearby vertices, such as in the example above where it snapped to the crossing.\r\n\r\nSame with entrances on building outlines:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4661658/235497181-6aa55fad-9957-4cde-9b7d-4b830c57686d.mp4\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nWhy specifically allow adding and modifying traffic calmings in the parking overlay, what has one to do with the other? It's actually even more specific than that: It's only about traffic calmings that (may) narrow the road in one way or another - mostly about curb extensions.\r\nThis is important because when mapping street parking, there is somewhat of a fluent transition between `parking:<side>=lane` (street parking) and `parking:<side>=street_side`. See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Street_parking#Distinction_between_street_side_and_lane_parking\r\n\r\n# Further changes\r\n\r\n- Data structure of element edits changed. Local edits database is cleared on update - a warning must be posted about that in a prior update.\r\n\r\n# Todo\r\n\r\nAll the fundamental changes are done, now just remain some minor UI improvements. Review of the done parts is highly appreciated (also after merge).\r\n\r\n- Test this vertex-creation stuff with real data - and also reverting it",
