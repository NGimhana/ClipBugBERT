    "body": "Hi, thanks again for the project.\r\nThis is trying to address the following issues:\r\n- #2209\r\n- fixes #2327\r\n- fixes #2871\r\n\r\nHere is an example user experience idea of how to start recording a track, and then composing a note. Right now I am able to record the history of gps points, and have it stored in the NoteEdits database object for later uploading to the server. I also changed to visualization to highlight these recorded segments in red.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2222562/145152485-8515dfe5-b2c2-480f-a2de-b8187caa7c7d.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the GPX track will be linked to the note (same as how images are currently) so this can provide additional information for editors and can be a part of the online \"Public GPS Traces\" overlay. The next step is for me to implement uploading to the gps trace server (I was looking at using some of [this code](https://github.com/westnordost/osmapi/blob/master/libs/traces/src/main/java/de/westnordost/osmapi/traces/GpsTracesApi.java)), so any feedback is much appreciated.\r\n",
