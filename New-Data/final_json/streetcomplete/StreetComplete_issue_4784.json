    "body": "Because of [this line](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/blob/master/app/src/main/java/de/westnordost/streetcomplete/view/controller/AutoCorrectAbbreviationsViewController.kt#L51), whenever one is typing in a name for a street or a place, it always capitalizes the first letter of each word in the street name. While this is great for many languages where uppercase letters are used at the start of each word in toponyms, this is a problem in other languages where that's not the case. For example, in Georgian language, while capital letters are included in the Unicode standard, they are not used for title casing. This makes it really annoying to input street names, as one has to edit the words afterwards to remove the capitalization.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best solution for this would be. Perhaps add a list of \"exception\" languages which are not to be titlecased, or even a simple toggle to disable the feature.\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce**\r\n\r\nStart solving a \"Street Name\" quest somewhere in Georgia, type in street name in Georgian. The first letters are automatically capitalized, even though they shouldn't be.\r\n\r\nHere's what it looks like:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18467667/215851298-f3f8194d-74bb-4378-a82d-e9f1d5544de4.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nNo tilte-casing occurs.\r\n\r\n**Versions affected**\r\n\r\nv50.2 (latest from F-Droid)\r\n",
