    "body": "**How to Reproduce**\r\n\r\n**Sometimes**, SC is unable to complete scanning for quests, showing the \"quest download\" spinner for long periods of time (forever? Although I've never had a patience to wait more than 5 minutes - normally, when it works, it finishes in few to dozen seconds at most)\r\n \r\nWhile it might possibly be due to weak mobile signal at the moment, there might be other reasons. (this time I think I had solid 4G signal all the time, but I can't promise that).\r\n\r\nRegardless of the reason, when one attempts to abort such scan and initiate new one by pressing `Scan for quests here` button, instead of being show regular `scan here instead` / `continue current scan` dialog, **nothing happens** and spinner continues to spin. See enclosed video:\r\n \r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156656/137832432-2403af2f-2621-4f10-b384-cab7c0f45352.mp4\r\n\r\nIt would be great if `Scan for quests here` would _always_ show that dialog allowing the user to abort current scan and initiate new one.\r\n\r\n**Versions affected**\r\nAndroid 10, SC `v36.0` (f-droid upstream)\r\n",
