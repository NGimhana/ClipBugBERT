    "body": "In this example, higher-priority `cycleway` quest is not being asked until lower-priority `speed limit` quest was answered.\r\n\r\n**How to Reproduce**\r\nEnable both quests, with `cycleway` having priority (being positioned above) `speed limit` quest. I would expect that first `cycleway` quest was asked, and then `speed limit`. If reality, it happens in opposite order. It happened in several different locations, here is one example (at https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/101165290):\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/156656/142738455-f69ff98a-b0b1-4ad6-9d12-c8af849a3797.mp4\r\n\r\nNote: `cycleway` quest is asked at the middle of the road, while `speed limit` is asked on both ends of the road, don't know if it is related.\r\n\r\n**Versions affected**\r\nStreetComplete `v38.0beta1+` (actually https://github.com/mnalis/StreetComplete/commit/2c130289d227bb943c25fdc4d50bbe31ff9c46b3) on Android 10",
