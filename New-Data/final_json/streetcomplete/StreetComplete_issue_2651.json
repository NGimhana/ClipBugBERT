    "body": "**Use case**\r\nCertain quest types use a \"Select\" window. Items at the top of this window are hard to reach when using a phone one-handed, on large-screen phones.\r\n\r\nI notice this problem particularly in the cycleway quest, where (at least round my way) the usual answer is that there is no cycleway (top-left of the screen), which has to be set for both sides of the street. Moving the thumb repeatedly from the bottom to the top and back again is irritating!\r\n\r\nSee video:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2512915/110660581-9a264980-81bb-11eb-9622-72df9e652dc7.mp4\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\nIt would be nice instead if the Select windows could be made to work more like the windows that appear when setting a surface type (asphalt etc.), which appear at the bottom of the screen, with the most recently-used entries first, and where the user can scroll up to see other entries.\r\n\r\nSee video:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2512915/110660844-e1143f00-81bb-11eb-92a4-b66ffbdfe01a.mp4\r\n",
