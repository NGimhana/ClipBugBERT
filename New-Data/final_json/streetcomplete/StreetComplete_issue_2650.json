That is, it will be above/alongside the road (looking like the quest is for a building instead), not on the road.\r\n\r\nI think the centre of the small circle should align with the tip of the pin.\r\n\r\nHopefully these two videos will make this clear - look at the four quests along a road in the middle of the screen. Also see how they seem to move from one side of the road to the other when the map is rotated.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2512915/110649903-f71d0200-81b1-11eb-8a62-c53b1349a64c.mp4\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2512915/110655287-d30fef80-81b6-11eb-9137-ccb1ea0f7160.mp4\r\n\r\n<!-- Add steps to reproduce this behavior -->\r\n\r\n**Versions affected**\r\n<!-- Add the Android and StreetComplete version -->\r\nAndroid 9, StreetComplete 31\r\n",
